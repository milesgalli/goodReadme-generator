# Description

This asssignment involved using Inquirer Node Package to create a Readme file for a users GitHub repository. It also uses the Axios Node Package to send an AJAX call to the GitHb Api.To retrieve the users username and avatar url. I used the this application to create the basic format for this readme!

# Installation:

Once you clone the repo, run npm install in the command line to install the required dependencies (i.e. inquirer and axios). Make sure you have node installed.

# Usage:
Once the app is set up, run node index.js and answer the questions to generate your readme. The only thing that breaks the app is if the username entered doesn't match one found on GitHub. But don't worry! You can just run node index.js again to retry.


# Final Thoughts:
This assignment took abit of getting used to, i found the filtering and creating the readme resposne abit tricky. Im still getting used to the command prompts and working out of the terminal. I still find dealing with objects abit annoying, but as we transition into object oriented programming. More practice with objects should improve my confidence when working with them. g with them. g with them. milesgalli
